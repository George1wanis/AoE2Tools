You can make a custom backup of your game files as you can see bellow. (I highly recommend using this feature to backup/restore your hotkeys, savegames especially at the public release of WK 5.7.4 or later. Be warned that Wk Installer removes savegames / hotkeys.)
You can also make a full backup of the entire installation game folder.

# Disclaimer

AoE2Tools respects all copyrights of Microsoft and it does not distribute age of empires 2 in any manner. AoE2Tool completely relies on your age of empires 2 HD assets and game license to legally convert AoE2HD to Age of Empires 2 The Conquerors.

AoE2Tools is able to detect existing installations of The conquerors version and hence no conversion is need.

I DO NOT take any responsibility for misuse or illegal exploitation of this tool.
