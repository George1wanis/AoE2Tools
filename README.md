# Disclaimer

AoE2Tools respects all copyrights of Microsoft and it does not distribute age of empires 2 in any manner. AoE2Tool completely relies on your age of empires 2 HD assets and game license to legally convert AoE2HD to Age of Empires 2 The Conquerors.

AoE2Tools is able to detect existing installations of The conquerors version and hence no conversion is need.

I DO NOT take any responsibility for misuse or illegal exploitation of this tool.
